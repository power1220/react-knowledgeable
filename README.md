## How to Speak on ${ GREATER_FE_SHARING_NAME }

### Lightning Talks

We will have lightning talks on open topics with a new-joiner, open-signup, and lucky-draw basis.

**How long do I have to ⚡️ lighten?**

> You will ⚡️ lighten for 7 mins.

**What should I talk about to ⚡️ lighten?**

- prior projects
- pitch or prelaunch your open source project
- life stories, philosophy of the universe
- ... and more

See here for an example of a lightning talk: Andres Suarez - [Moving Fast with Nuclide and Flow](https://youtu.be/WRyk5ZVklFs)

**Cool, how do I ⚡️ lighten?**

You fill up the form on [this page](./call-for-lightnings) by creating a merge request in this repo. Once the schedule is confirmed, we'll move that to the monthly roster, get prepared :)

- New joiners each month will automatically be enrolled for next month's roster
- Open sign-ups: by the Friday one week before each week's sharing.
- Lucky draws to fill 2 lightning talks

**Before You Speak**: Let's pre-⚡️ and do a dry-run by the Monday before your sharing slot
