# Call for Ô∏èüåö Featured

Please add your topic in the table below. Once scheduled, we'll move your row to the agenda.

For video options, please indicate one of the following:

- **no video**: Do not videotape at all. I sweat knowing there's a camera
- **video but do not publish to public channels**: I want to use the video for my own improvement on public speaking
- **ok to publish**: Of course if you feel your talk don't turn out well as expected we can alwasy revoke this. But otherwise Let's do this :)
